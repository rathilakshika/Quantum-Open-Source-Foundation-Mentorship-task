# Quantum-Open-Source-Foundation-Mentorship-task

The task is done as a part of the QOSF mentorship program.

The given code aims at preparing a 4-qubit quantum state using parameterised gates. The minimum distance between the state and a randomly generated vector is found by optimising the values of the parameters. The optimisation was done using the Gradient Descent Algorithm.
The code uses Qiskit as the Quantum simulator.
